## Steps I Took

1. Provision my Linux server on AWS.
2. Install and configure Nginx and Apache but hosted with Apache.
3. Deploy the provided `index.html`.
4. Configure HTTP traffic (port 80).
5. Optional: Set up HTTPS using Letâ€™s Encrypt. Kind of use certbot and secured my HTML page.
6. I did purchase a domain. I played around with AWS load balancer, amazon cloudfront and direct installation with my /etc... file.
